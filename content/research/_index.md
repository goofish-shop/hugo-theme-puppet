### CRISPR-based functional genomics platforms

We are developing innovative functional genomics platforms by combining CRISPR screening with other cutting-edge technologies including iPSC differentiation, single cell sequencing, automated high-content imaging and in vivo disease modeling. Using these tools, we aim to uncover cellular and molecular mechanisms of human neurological diseases and develop novel therapeutic strategies


### Stress response in human neurons

Neurons, as one of the longest-living cell types in the human body, are challenged by various stresses in aging and disease. Due to their post-mitotic nature, neurons do not have the ability to ‘self-renew’ by cell division. Therefore, robust stress response mechanisms are required for neurons to maintain long-term health. We are interested in understanding how neurons response to various cellular stresses in normal and disease conditions and how we could prevent neurons from stress-induced degeneration in diseases. In particular, we are interested in understanding oxidative stress response in neurons and how ferroptosis is regulated in human neurons.
